# Lacuna-Web-Client-jQuery

Rewrite of the current Lacuna Expanse Web Client using jQuery & friends. **Note:** *Thanks to all those who contributed, but this project is no longer moving. :weary:*

# Buildings

The following is the list of buildings that needs to be implemented. If you think you can code a building or two, open up the `buildingType/planetaryCommand.js` file and have a look at the notes we've written in there for you.

* Archaeology
* BlackHoleGenerator
* Capitol
* DeployedBleeder
* Development
* Embassy
* Entertainment
* GeneticsLab
* Intelligence
* IntelTraining
* LibraryOfJith
* MayhemTraining
* MercenariesGuild
* MiningMinistry
* MissionCommand
* Network19
* Observatory
* Park
* PlanetaryCommand
    * @Vasari will be writing the code for this plus a bunch of explanatory notes for those starting with the code here.
        * Finished:
            * Planet Tab
            * Rename Tab
            * Plans Tab
            * Resources Tab
            * Storage Tab
        * TODO:
            * Abandon Tab:
                * Abandoning a planet involves a planet change, which hasn't been implemented yet. @Vasari plans to look at this in the near future.
            * Supply Chains Tab
                * Due to the fact that the Supply Chain API is not working in the YUI client, I can't setup a test supply chain. Meaning, everything I've coded there is untested. We'll be able to fix this when the Trade Ministry gets implemented. Unless, there's an account on the server using a supply chain right now, I'll have to get @icydee to have a look.
* PoliticsTraining
* Security
* Shipyard
    * @Vasari is working on this one.
    * So far, a very basic version of viewing the build queue is available.
* SpacePort
    * @icydee plans to work on this, and on other bits of code that display lists of ships (starmaps etc.)
* SpaceStationLab
* SubspaceSupplyDepot
* TempleOfTheDrajilites
* TheDillonForge
* TheftTraining
* ThemePark
* Trade
* Transporter
